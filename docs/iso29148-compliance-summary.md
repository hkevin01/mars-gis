- **Cross-Reference Validation:** Requirements reviewed for conflicts and dependencies
- **Integrated Constraints:** All constraints consistently applied across relevant requirements

**Quality Assurance:**
- No conflicting performance targets
- Security requirements align with usability requirements
- Scalability requirements support performance requirements

**Standard Requirement:** Mechanisms to trace each requirement to its source and related design elements.

**Our Implementation:**
- **Stakeholder Traceability:** Each requirement traces to specific stakeholder needs
- **Design Traceability:** Requirements link to architectural design elements
- **Test Traceability:** Each requirement maps to specific test cases
- **Bi-directional Tracking:** Forward and backward traceability maintained

**Traceability Matrix Example:**
```
| Requirement ID | Source Stakeholder | Design Element | Test Case | Verification Status |
|----------------|-------------------|----------------|-----------|-------------------|
| FR-DM-001 | Mission Scientists | NASA Data Client | TC-NASA-001 | ‚úÖ Verified |
| FR-ML-003 | Mission Planners | Landing Site Optimizer | TC-ML-003 | ‚úÖ Verified |
```

### 5. **‚úÖ Feasibility**

**Standard Requirement:** Requirements must be realistically achievable within constraints.

**Our Implementation:**
- **Technical Feasibility:** All requirements based on proven technologies and existing implementations
- **Resource Constraints:** Requirements aligned with $2M budget and 18-month timeline
- **Technology Constraints:** Requirements specify achievable performance targets based on current capabilities
- **Risk Assessment:** High-complexity requirements include feasibility validation

**Feasibility Validation:**
- Performance targets based on existing system benchmarks
- AI/ML accuracy targets validated against current state-of-the-art
- Infrastructure requirements aligned with available cloud platforms
- Timeline estimates based on proven development methodologies

### 6. **‚úÖ Verifiability**

**Standard Requirement:** Requirements stated to enable testing or verification.

**Our Implementation:**
- **Specific Verification Methods:** Each requirement specifies exact verification approach
  - Testing (unit, integration, system, performance)
  - Inspection (code review, design review)
  - Analysis (static analysis, modeling)
  - Demonstration (live system demonstrations)

- **Measurable Acceptance Criteria:** All requirements include quantifiable pass/fail conditions
