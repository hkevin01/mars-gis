Comprehensive file analysis completed - MARS-GIS project specifications extracted

BEAST MODE ACTIVATED - Beginning autonomous implementation of complete MARS-GIS project
Task detected: Implement complete MARS-GIS project as specified in plan.md

COMPREHENSIVE TODO LIST:
- [x] Create project directory structure with all folders (.copilot, .github, .vscode, assets, data, docs, scripts, src, tests, venv)
- [x] Implement all configuration files (.gitignore, .editorconfig, pyproject.toml, requirements.txt)
- [x] Create VS Code workspace configuration (settings.json, launch.json, tasks.json)
- [x] Set up GitHub workflows and templates (CI/CD pipeline, issue templates, PR template)
- [x] Implement GitHub Copilot configuration (.copilot/settings.yml)
- [x] Create comprehensive documentation (README.md, project_plan.md, CHANGELOG.md, LICENSE)
- [x] Build core Python package structure (src/mars_gis with all modules)
- [x] Implement FastAPI application architecture (main.py, API routes, core config)
- [x] Create database models and schema (PostgreSQL/PostGIS integration)
- [x] Implement data processing modules (NASA/USGS API integration)
- [ ] Build AI/ML components (PyTorch models for terrain analysis)
- [ ] Create visualization components (3D Mars globe, interactive mapping)
- [ ] Implement geospatial analysis engine (terrain reconstruction, path planning)
- [ ] Build web interface (React frontend, real-time dashboard)
- [ ] Create utility scripts (environment setup, data download, database initialization)
- [x] Implement comprehensive test suite (unit tests, integration tests)
- [ ] Set up monitoring and logging infrastructure
- [ ] Create deployment configuration (Docker, Kubernetes)
- [ ] Implement security features (authentication, authorization, encryption)
- [ ] Add performance optimization (caching, database indexing, GPU acceleration)

PROGRESS: 45% complete - Core Python package structure and FastAPI application framework implemented successfully.

CONTINUING IMPLEMENTATION: Data processing modules completed successfully.

✓ Database models created with comprehensive Mars geospatial schema
✓ NASA Mars data integration client implemented
✓ USGS geological data integration client implemented  
✓ Sample data generation script created for development

Next phase: Implementing AI/ML components for terrain analysis and hazard detection.

Creating machine learning models for:
- Mars terrain classification using CNN architectures
- Landing site safety assessment algorithms
- Atmospheric analysis and dust storm prediction
- Real-time hazard detection from satellite imagery
